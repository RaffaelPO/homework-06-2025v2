# Homework assignment of the 2024 Lede Program
 
This repository contains a homework assignment completed as part of the **[Lede Program](https://ledeprogram.com/) 2024** edition.
The work was finished on February 3, 2025, and focuses on building foundational skills in data analysis with pandas.

 ## Description

The repository includes two Jupyter notebooks designed as an introduction to pandas and basic data exploration techniques:
 `01-Animals.ipynb`: an introductory notebook that functions as a pandas cheat sheet, covering core concepts and commonly used methods.
 `02-Billionaires.ipynb`: a data analysis exercise based on a billionaires dataset, used to answer a series of questions and practice essential pandas operations. 

 Throughout the assignment, the focus is on understanding and applying fundamental pandas functionality, including: 
 - Data inspection: `.info()`, `.head()`;
 - Sorting, counting and filtering: `.sort_values()`, `value_counts()`, and multiple conditions;
 - Basic data visualization: `plot`;
 - General dataframe manipulation and exploration

 ### Python libraries needed/installed: 
- pandas
- matplotlib
